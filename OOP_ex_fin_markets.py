'''
1) Create a Stock class that has properties for the stock symbol, current price, and the date of the last trade. Write methods to get and set these properties.

2) Create a Portfolio class that holds a collection of Stock objects. Write methods to add and remove stocks from the portfolio.

3) Add a method to the Stock class that calculates the percentage change in price from the last trade. Create a Stock object and print the result.

4) Create a Trade class that holds information about a stock trade, including the stock symbol, the price at which it was bought or sold, and the date of the trade.

5) Modify the Portfolio class to keep track of trades made on each stock, including the number of shares bought or sold, the price paid or received, and the date of the trade.

6) Add a method to the Portfolio class that calculates the total value of all the stocks in the portfolio, based on their current prices.

7) Create a BrokerageAccount class that holds information about a customer's account balance and the stocks they own. Write methods to buy and sell stocks from the account.

8) Modify the Trade class to include information about the brokerage account used to make the trade.

9) Add a method to the BrokerageAccount class that calculates the customer's net worth, based on the value of their stocks and their account balance.

10) Create a MarketData class that provides information about the current price of a stock. Write a method to simulate the market, randomly updating the prices of all stocks in the portfolio.

11) Add a method to the Trade class that calculates the profit or loss from the trade, based on the current price of the stock and the price paid or received in the trade.
